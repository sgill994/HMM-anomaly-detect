# Hidden Markov Models (HMM) Performance Analysis

This repository contains the code and data manipulation scripts used in the analysis of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for anomaly detection in electricity consumption data.  
The project involves training multivariate HMMs on household energy consumption data, selecting optimal response variables using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and evaluating model performance through metrics like log-likelihood, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).  
Models were tested across a range of states, with cross-validation used to establish thresholds for anomaly detection. For detailed findings, refer to the comprehensive report linked below.
